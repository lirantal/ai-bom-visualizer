# AI-BOM Viewer

A single-page viewer for **CycloneDX AI Bill of Materials** (AI-BOM). Renders components (models, agents, MCP servers, libraries, etc.) and their dependencies as an interactive constellation graph. Built to output one self-contained **`dist/index.html`** — no server required.

## Deployed Version

The AI-BOM Visualizer project is also deployed live here for public use: [https://ai-bom-visualizer.vercel.app](https://ai-bom-visualizer.vercel.app)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # → dist/index.html (single file, all assets inlined)
npm run preview  # preview production build
```

Default BOM comes from **`data.json`** at project root (injected into the HTML at build time); edit it and rebuild to change the default graph. See [docs/project.md](docs/project.md) for build and data source details. To build a data-free viewer for another project to inject their BOM later, use **`npm run build:template`** — see [docs/html-template.md](docs/html-template.md).
