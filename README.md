# AI-BOM Viewer

A single-page viewer for **CycloneDX AI Bill of Materials** (AI-BOM). Renders components (models, agents, MCP servers, libraries, etc.) and their dependencies as an interactive constellation graph. Built to output one self-contained **`dist/index.html`** — no server required.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # → dist/index.html (single file, all assets inlined)
npm run preview  # preview production build
```

Default BOM comes from **`data.json`** at project root; edit it and rebuild to change the default graph. See [docs/project.md](docs/project.md) for build and data source details.
